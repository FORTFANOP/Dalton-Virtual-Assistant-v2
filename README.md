# Dalton-Virtual-Assistant-v2
A version 2 of the initial Virtual Assistant I had created last year. This version includes improved speech recognition, multiple new functionalities, along with an AI neural network which runs through the user input and gets back with the most relevant result. (Not very advanced, future plans include integrating this into GPT architecture (someone pls help))
